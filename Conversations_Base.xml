Wanderer! Orphan of the salt! Hear me!

To the North and the West, through the Great Salt Desert, the Six Day Stilt splits the earth in two! Seek there the grandeur of Shekhinah, First among Fathers. Release =player.reflexive= from the burden that chrome bears on your sickly flesh.

Go, now!

Deliverance waits for all pilgrims.

At the site, you will find the cathedral, magnificent in its splendor. There are statues erected in honor of the Argent Fathers. There are sublime reliefs depicting our most cherished occasions. Hear, too, the wisdom of Eschelstadt II, our highest priest, and make a donation at the Sacred Well. Worship at the light sculpture of Shekhinah Himself.

You will find other pilgrims among the merchant tents at the Stiltgrounds bazaar, other converts and priests. You will be among friends.

The Gyre was a series of seven plagues that spread through and out of Qud a thousand years ago. One of these plagues was a scourge of girshlings, and they heralded the coming of the seventh plague, the Girsh Nephilim. These were terrible demons who ate the young of kith and kin. Resheph slew them, but now that girshlings are back, we don't know what to make of the Nephilim.

        You see, wayfarer, one thousand years ago, in the last days of the sultanate, a series of seven plagues called the Gyre spread through and out of Qud. They were a long-stewing punishment for some trespass committed in the soft sludge of primordium, before even the sultans reigned.

        You share the pessimism of my kin, and several of the priests as well. My heart hears you, but listen to my words, and maybe you will come to feel as I do.

        To devalue wisdom is to devalue the Kasaphescence. She shines in the void, refracting light, illuminating those around her. So does the written wisdom of our elders.

        The machinery of chromium is complex in its divinity. Don't we do a disservice to our Fathers when we remain ignorant of it, of our past, of our future? Don't we deserve the joy of knowing? Bless Eschelstadt II, first Child, for he believes as I do.

Unfortunately, it's encrypted, and we do not have the means here to decrypt it. You may be of some help in this matter, however.

        We've long known the location of a fully functioning &amp;Wbaetyl&amp;y within the bowels of the great hall &amp;CBethesda Susa&amp;y. The Mechanimists have consecrated the site around it and built a temple there. Q Girl claims to have developed a means to decrypt the signal, but she needs the computing power of the baetyl. If you can infiltrate the Mechanimist compound, you may be able to engage the baetyl and decode the signal.

Often one claims to possess a sentience of its own. However, most of them have gone haywire in the eons since their creation; it is rare indeed to discover one whose circuitry is wholly uncorroded.

        The Mechanimists worship this one as an idol, and they will protect it at all costs. You will need to find a way through their host to the baetyl itself.

        The climber design relies on the use of electromagnets to interface with the planet's magnetic field and generate torque. Unfortunately, the Spindle generates its own interfering field, perhaps as a mechanism to prevent unwanted ascension.

        Our aim is to access the Spindle's control unit and disable the field. How we accomplish this, however, is an enigma. From disparate bits across the archives of the digitum, Ereshkigal has stitched together a cryptic but instructional brocade.

        I do. Your service to the guild has been laudable, disciple. You braved the vaporous depths of Bethesda Susa and decoded the signal, you secured the Spindlegrounds and handled the self-appointed Earl, and perhaps most materially, you defended our enclave from the Putus Templar.

        Since you returned from Bethesda, you've no doubt wondered at the signal's contents. Verily, I hid them to shield you from the weight of the truth. Only Otho, Q Girl, and I bear that burden, but circumstances have changed. The river of Time powers the gear train of our schemes and devices, and it rushes forth. From here, I must share the burden. You must know.

      <text>
        The beacon confirmed my hypothesis. The Spindle is an elevator, engineered by the Eaters to convey freight to and from the vault of heaven. You see, nestling, in the earliest aurora of our past, the Eaters of Earth were joined by a great coven of beings that spanned the firmament. But the Eaters succumbed to some terrible temptation, and an injunction was placed on our world.

        Since then, the stars were silent to us, and our world was left to molder and decay. But something changed. The signal affirms that an entity roosts atop the Spindle, and invites us to join it.

        Dare I say, is the injunction at an end? It's too early to tell, but alas, there could be hope for our world.

      <text>
        I intend to ascend the Spindle and answer the call, disciple.

        My protege &amp;mQ Girl&amp;y has designed a climber for the ascent. We intended to construct it piecewise at the enclave and the site itself, but the engineering feat exceeds even our capacity. With time, I am confident we could accomplish it, but the Putus Templar rob us of our patience. We need to act now, and so as loath as I am to admit it, we need Pax Klanq.

    <node ID="PaxKlanq">
      <text>
        Pax Klanq is an eccentric mushroom prodigy. All its faults aside, it's a brilliant scientist and engineer, and I have little doubt that it could build the climber faster than we could. Several years have passed since we were last in contact, but it owes us a debt, and we must now collect.

        Unfortunately, no one knows Pax Klanq's whereabouts. Through contacts I made over the years, I inquired as to its location. The most I was able to garner were these enigmatic instructions:

        "Seek the heart of the rainbow, eat the god's flesh, and follow the Coral Path."

        I must ask you to decipher this enigma, find Pax Klanq, and convince it to construct the climber. Remind Pax of the debt it owes us.

        I have visited the rainbow wood but once, and there I sampled an array of strange foods, one of which allowed me an unusual lens through which to view the world. It was nothing like I had ever experienced, and I imagined such wondrous recipes. I wrote them all down as best I could, of course.

        Sadly, once I returned to my ordinary frame of reference, my scribblings proved impossible to read. So it goes.

        What you smell is Grit Gate's signature dish. The Porridge is a recipe passed down through generations of Barathrumites, and it is the food that inspired me to pursue my craft. Yes, outsiders quail at the intensity of the scent, for its flavor is as bold as its effects!

        We use cuisine to channel lightning from our bodies! Other recipes may let us breathe fire, or learn the secrets of the Eaters. The Porridge is as precious a part of our legacy as the Barathrum Clock or the foaminator.

        You are sharp, =name=. In a way that's what I am. But liquids are more willful than scrap. I can't solder them together; they would run away, hide in the shale cracks, slowly come apart and disappear. I moreso think of myself as a wisewoman in dialog with them -- I manage their moods and phases. My notebooks are full of their quirks and caprices. It's a wonder, isn't it, how at just the right temperature and pressure the continuity of matter is smashed apart? How the gaseous butterfly flits out of the dense worm?

        After supper I like to retreat to the library, take a storybook off the shelves, flop down on the chairbear, and lose myself in another world. Many of these worlds feature palaces, markets, gardens, ships. Many of those places have bells. When they do, I always think of Mafeo. More than anyone else, Mafeo could be a character in the bright world of a story, where this dusty place is itself confined to a mere storybook.

        Don't I know it. I've had to invent eight separate systems of organization to manage them all. At the moment I'm trying out a new one, Harmonices Spiralis. Spiral towers with heights increasing according to the harmonic series of numbers. It's... fine.

        The problem is I'm always inscribing more disks. New contraptions. Reverse-engineered artifacts. It's a good problem to have, I suppose.

        Take a look. See if any interest you.

        We remain secluded to protect ourselves. Otho and Barathrum insist on it. They are wise, and I defer to them. My collaboration with Sheba Hag does cause them worry, but they tolerate it, bless their hearts.

        It's a big bear city with a lot of books and scratched brass and strange noises. But if you start chanting in sync with the noises Otho will hush you. It's sort of like this, let me explain.

        Iseppa is napping so you peek into her room and rearrange her papers.
        Then you walk down the hall and say "ding ding" so Mafeo shakes his head and dings back.
        Then you foaminate by Hortensa. You foaminate right on by. You hug her too.
        Then you scoot over and hug Spara.
        Then you scoot over to Jacobo and look over his shoulder and nod like this.

        Then you sneak by Otho's office.
        Then you hug Shem -1 and you drag them to the library and read to them. Sometimes Barathrum and Hortensa are in there, and they smile at you.
        Then you get hungry and you roll toward the kitchen. You slurp honey from the vase and Dardi glares at you. You say, "I'm just 'jidding'."
        Then you climb the pipes and whisper to Aloysius, "Live and drink, live and drink, live and drink."
        Then you pat the chromelings on their heads. You say to Ereshkigal, "boom boom boom boom boom I love you."
        Then you sneak into storage and pat all the chromelings on their heads.
        You take a nap in the peptic chair.
        Then you get a bright idea and go back to your room to write it in your notebook.

        The Rainbow Wood is a fair bit too dangerous for a casual promenade, but nothing compares to its beauty. Once, I viewed it from above by means of a gyrocopter, and I will never forget the sights that I saw.

        Nor will I forget crashing to the ground because the gyrocopter broke, but every adventure has its complications, wouldn't you say?

We were of two different minds -- they desired nothing but to bludgeon everything to death, while I asked, "What is the nature of this thing we bludgeon? Or of the act itself?" Recognizing that my answers lay elsewhere, I cast myself upon the byroads of Qud, as a lovesick sailor casts the bottle that bears his sonnets upon the surf, hoping I'd be guided toward the wisdom I sought by my desire to seek it.

I've remained here ever since in contemplation of those questions that first stirred in me all those years ago.

        There is a river just north of the village that runs an eastwardly course into the jungle. Along its bank lies a goatfolk village. There resides a mighty shaman, Mamon Souldrinker. He is in possession of a talisman of great power, an amaranthine prism that refracts the psyche of its handler in much the same way, as Mayor Nuntu has explained to me, a common prism refracts light. The thing is cursed, traveler. No man or goat may safely wield it for long. You must travel to the village and retrieve the prism from Mamon by any means necessary. Do you understand?

      <text>
        There is. Firstly, Mamon will likely have several goatfolk under his enthrallment, and they will protect him at all costs.

        Secondly, take care to stay out of Mamon's reach, for his power is most potent when he may lay hands on you.

        Finally, once you recover the prism, do not under any circumstances wield it. I needn't warn you of the consequences should you return to me bearing that charm.

        That is all. Are you willing?

        We hindren are a close-knit and staid people, and our safety depends on our solidarity. In order to preserve our safety and culture, we ask that any of our number who leave us never come back. Recently, one such exile took the treasure of our village, a bracelet named Kindrish, with her when she left. None of our number can leave to get it back, or it will be a violation of the values that I have guarded, and the Hindriarchs before me, for countless generations.

        Though her name is sand in my mouth now, the exile who stole Kindrish is called Eskhind. She left a few weeks ago, and took her sister and brother with her. I don't know where she's gone, but Warden Neelahind might, as they were close friends as children.

        Find the exile called Eskhind and retrieve Kindrish from her, even... even if the cost is the life of her and her siblings. Kindrish has been handed down over countless generations, and it belongs to my people, not any individual. Go, kendren. Speak to Warden Neelahind, and find out where Eskhind is hidden.

If you ask the exile, I'm sure she'll spin some kind of accusation that I believe gender to be an immutable prison, that I impose it on others.

She's lying. Our people have a long history of two-gender hindren called {{w|hartind}}, respected and consecrated. There is a proper path to gender variance in our society, of which the male exile could have availed himself years ago.

He never did, so I do not recognize him.

      <text>
Keh is very wise and very careful, which makes up for her lack of strength or... tact. She always knows what's right, and she runs a very tight shift.

She hates clutter from work like nothing else and cleans up any mess she makes--unless it's a spill, then she makes Kesehind do it. It's because Grand-Doe has a terrible fear of standing pools of water, refusing to touch them. Copper and bronze afflict her with allergy-sores and she can't touch them. She's too old to spar with me, but her bow-arm still aims true.

That's all I can think of.

Oh. She's, well, she's a good person with strong convictions, or has always seemed so. I suppose that isn't helpful.

Esk has a good eye for detail. She hates watervine so much that she avoids the paddies and won't eat matz without lah broth to make it taste better. Umm, she's afraid of saltbacks. She's good at foraging and terrible at crafting.

I've missed her so much.

Kesehind is completely loyal to Grand-Doe. We used to be friends, but his disposition has become so sour since he was appointed her protector, and he's quite cold to me now. He can't see well in darkness. He's the holder of Ari, an unbreakable heirloom fire axe, and he's very skilled with it.

He's terribly finicky about food. He'll only eat bland food and meat, and... oh! Once, when he had a bad cough as a faundren, a caretaker tried to feed him yuckwheat, and he kicked her so hard it dislocated her jaw. Poor Elder Eselhind.

The evidence is clear: Eskhind did not steal Kindrish. The crime was committed by none other than Grand-Doe's protector, Kesehind. He will be stripped of the ancestral axe he carries, stripped of his property, and stripped from our oral histories. Never will his name be spoken here again, and he will never return... on pain of death.

Moreover... Keh's attempt to pin blame on Eskhind without due process opened my eyes to her abuses of power. She need not leave Bey Lah, but she is Keh-hind once more-- stripped of her title and standing.

The question isn't why I left, it's why I'm the only one who chose to do so, why none of my pleas were convincing to the hindren I love. If we would just open the borders, it would never have come to this.

        The Hindriarch is the most likely suspect, in my opinion. She might have kept it for herself or sold it. I've been suspicious of her pet bodyguard, Kesehind, for years--I wouldn't put it past him to steal the treasure himself.
        
        That said, it might have been an outsider like you. I doubt any of the villagers had the nerve to steal such a valuable object, but I suppose it's faintly possible.

        But it wasn't Neelahind. You won't find a purer heart in all of Qud than hers.

It is my dearest hope that one day I shall be known not as Angohind, village bookworm... but Angohind, Master Detective.

        Every mystery hinges on the detection and interpretation of evidence. As Hemlock Cones said:

        Ere any prosecution can commence,

    <node ID="Finding evidence">
      <text>
        Professor Cones taught me everything about finding evidence!

        Though evidence you found upon the ground may yet be sound,
        If it will be sufficient is a toss-up.
        Examine all your suspects and their homes and all around,
        And find a witness who may dish the gossip.

        You can find evidence by looking at things on the ground, but you can also look at your suspects to see if there's anything off about them. You can also ask around to see if anyone has seen or heard anything strange, and different witnesses may have different things to report.

      <text>
Evidence is any sign of something gone amiss. The Great Plant Detective gave some good examples in Act II of the tragedy of Gimlet:

So! Sweep the full estate for signs of {{W|trade}},
their shady night-time dealings to expose
Now look for signs of {{W|craft}}, see what was made
For to conceal a treasure hidden close.
But darker still, if {{W|illness}} signs we find
A desperate contagion may yet lurk
And darkest yet, more {{W|violence}} may reply
To those who stumble 'pon their grisly work.

    <node ID="Implicating evidence">
      <text>
        Implicating evidence is what it sounds like: evidence that implicates someone's involvement in a crime. For example, if someone observed strange behavior in a person, or if you found something weird in a person's room, or even if you observe them behaving strangely =player.reflexive=! That's implicating evidence.

        Most of the time, a piece of implicating evidence isn't proof of a crime in and of itself, but when presented alongside supporting evidence, implicating evidence is the seed of truth from which grows the long frond of justice.

      <text>
        Supporting evidence can be any sign that something is amiss that you can't directly tie to an individual. One common example is a bloodstain, which indicates that violence was committed but doesn't tell you by whom.

        At its heart, supporting evidence is most powerful when paired with implicating evidence. Once you have both, you'll be in a good position to accuse a suspect of wrongdoing.

        As Professor Cones said:

        We know the reach of law, however long,
        Is not the finest judge of right and wrong.
        Choose not what evidence thou wilt present
        Ere its consequence is evident.

        That's always a risk, kendren.

        Neelahind knows everyone in the village very well. If you present supporting evidence that contradicts something the Warden knows to be true about the suspect, well, she probably won't believe you. In fact, she might not let you accuse that person again, so be careful.

        If you make too many bad accusations, you might lose credibility with her entirely.

        I was once a vile graverobber, the lowest of the low. Years ago I sought to plunder the Tomb of the Eaters, and set off to do so with a pair of confederates. I watched both of them die, slain by ancient artifice and entombed with the ancient dead.

        I would have shared their fate, but for a coterie of mopango nesting in the catacombs. They kept me safe and fed me while I treated my wounds. It is in their honor that I seek a credo now.

        Yes. It is a rite of passage for the mopango people: a statement that inspires contemplation, discussion, and thought. An ideal credo has no single explanation or interpretation and is meant to inspire contemplation in those who hear it. For this reason, it is considered rude among mopango to ask the meaning of a credo.

        Mopango are plated, digging creatures whose armor scales glow a pale white. They are contemplative, sociable, and mostly peaceful. They commune with ancient objects, which is why a coterie of their kind lives in the Tomb of the Eaters.

        They are patient even with rough-hewn wanderers such as we, but it's still not best to ask one to explain eir credo.

If you do find =player.reflexive= in the Tomb, the mopango settlement is nestled in the wall of the Northwest Catacombs. The entrance is guarded by a chain turret named Vivira, brightly-painted to distinguish em from eir brethren.

        Ezra is more than tree-old. It's stone-old. Seedlings have lived here since our roots dreamed of joggling their fingers at the salt sky.

        They ate earth and belched freight at the stars, and this place was their stomach.

        Later, as the Star-Tree died and they buried their dead under its roots, this was their funerary place.

        Now, we nurse electric milk from the old and aching temple to turn our wheels and grind our seeds and grains. Now we are they.

        &amp;w*Herododicus whispers* &amp;yI'm sure your version is the better one, Moloch...

        'Tis a saying among the stonemasons, "Never finish a job too early." By the decretum of Sagittar, old as it is, they have until the Coiled Lamb is... is decom-.. passed... decompassed.... dead, deadlike... to complete their work on the Tomb.

        Bless the Coiled Lamb, peace to those who canter in his house, and let us pray the day never comes!
